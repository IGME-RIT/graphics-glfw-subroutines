Description:
In GLSL, a subroutine is a mechanism for binding a function call to one of a set of possible
function definitions based on the value of a variable. In many ways it is similar to function
pointers in C. A uniform variable serves as the pointer and is used to invoke the function.
The value of this variable can be set from the OpenGL side, thereby binding it to one of a few
possible definitions. The subroutine's function definitions need not have the same name, but
must have the same number and type of parameters and the same return type.

In this program, we draw two spheres and light them different using the same shaders using 
subroutines.
